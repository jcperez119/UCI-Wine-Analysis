# UCI-Wine-Analysis
Exploration into the wine data set provided by the UCI machine learning repository, with emphsis on classification and quality prediction using linear regression. 

## Overview
This project was initally part of the University of Washington Certificate Program in Data Analytics. After completion of the course, I have decieded to expand upon the initial 

## Objectives
- Clean and combine the origional datasets using R for later analysis
- 

## Summary

There were two primary datasets from the origional study. These will be merged into a single data set with two new columns: type (red/white) and quality class (good/bad).

1. Wine_Data/... - Contains red wine attributes:
   
2. Wine_Data/... - Contains white whine attributes:
   
3. Wine_Data/... - Combined datasets:
   - Num. of records: 
   - Columns:
     - Type (Type of wine, red or white.)
     - Fixed acidity (Refers to non-volatile acids in wine, that contribute to the wine's tartness and stability.)
     - Volatile acid (Measures the amount of acetic acid in wine.)
     - Citric Acid (A natural acid found in citrus fruits, contributing to the wine's freshness and flavor complexity.)
     - Residual Sugar (The amount of sugar remaining in wine after fermentation.)
     - Chlorides (Compounds derived from chlorine that can impact the taste of wine.)
     - Free Sulpher Dioxide (The portion of sulfur dioxide in wine that is active in preventing oxidation.)
     - Total Sulfur Dioxide (The total amount of both free and bound sulfur dioxide, used as a preservative and antioxidant.)
     - Density (The mass per unit volume of wine.)
     - pH (Acidity or basicity of wine.)
     - Sulphates (Compounds containing sulfur that contribute to the wine’s flavor.)
     - Alcohol (The reason you’re probably drinking the wine.)
     - Quality (The perceived quality of the wine, out of 10.)
     - Quality Class (Class...)
